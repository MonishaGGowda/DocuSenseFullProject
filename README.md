# DocuSense
DESCRIPTION:
Our prototype is a user-friendly data analysis and annotation platform that simplifies the process of extracting insights from textual data. Our “multi-agent” (AI and Human) tool facilitates document organization, annotation and linking of insights by enabling users to highlight content, add annotations and classify them based on their significance. The tool also provides functionality to generate insights from these annotations and visualize relationships across multiple documents, enhancing the depth of analysis.
To reduce cognitive load, the interface is divided into clear, manageable sections, which helps prevent information overload. Also, the user will not have to navigate back and forth repeatedly as annotations for current documents are visible on the same page. Visual indicators, such as color-coded relevancy markers, enable users to easily pinpoint important details, while filtering options allow for a focused examination of relevant data. This streamlined approach ensures that users can carry out complex analysis tasks with minimal mental strain.


1. Login/Sign-up Page: This is the main entry point of our prototype. It offers both login and sign-up options. Once a user logs in or signs up, they are directed to the creation page.
 
2. Creation Page (Homepage): The homepage provides two primary tools: "New Analysis" and "View My Analysis." Users can create a new document or view previously stored documents. Selecting the "New Analysis" option takes users to the list page.

3. List (Data Analysis) Page: This page displays a list of all created analysis. Based on feedback, we have added a "Delete Document" option. Clicking on a list item takes the user to the Annotations page.

4.	Annotations Page: The Annotations page is divided into three sections: left, center, and right.

 At the bottom of the page, there is a summary section offering two options: generate insights for the current document or generate insights for all documents. From this page, users can either navigate to the Connections page or return to the List page.

5. Connections Page: The Connections page allows users to view all the annotations they've created and trace them back to the source document. Users can connect annotations by filtering text and relevancy (high or low). Each annotation contains a link that directs back to the original document.
