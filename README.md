## Introduction to DocuSense  

Imagine going through a mountain of documents, trying to connect the dots, uncover hidden insights, and make sense of complex information. For many, this is the reality of data analysis. Traditional methods are tedious, requiring manual annotation, repetitive navigation, and significant mental effort. The risk of missing critical insights or making errors is high, especially with large datasets. Existing tools often add frustration with complicated workflows and steep learning curves.  

**DocuSense** transforms this process, offering a **powerful and user-friendly** solution. It simplifies how users interact with and analyze data, reducing complexity and inefficiency. Through an integration of **artificial intelligence and intuitive design**, DocuSense enables users to annotate documents, generate insights, and cross-reference information with ease.  

### Purpose  
This research explores how integrating **AI agents for summarizing insights from documents** can reduce cognitive load and enhance efficiency in data exploration. This approach aims to improve decision-making and user experience in document sensemaking tasks.
